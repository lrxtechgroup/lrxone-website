# MEMORY — lrxone-website

Running log of what's been done on this repo across sessions, so work can be picked up
without re-deriving context. Newest entries at the top. Update this file every time you
finish a unit of work here — don't just leave it to the next session to reconstruct.

## 2026-07-27 — Built real Privacy Policy and Terms of Service pages

Part of working through a rediscovered planning doc (`lrxtechgroup/lrxone`'s
`CLAUDE_TODO.md`, item 12). The earlier fix here (2026-07-25) deliberately
left the footer's Privacy Policy/Terms links pointed at `mailto:` rather
than fabricate legal content — the site owner has now supplied real
content (Information Officer, registered address, data processors,
retention periods, POPIA scope), so that block is lifted.

- New `privacy.html`: Information Officer (Brandon Le Roux), registered
  address, what's collected, the real data-processor list (AWS
  af-south-1, Anthropic, Stitch, PayFast, Stripe, Microsoft, Keycloak),
  retention (12 months post-cancellation, 7 years for financial records
  per FICA), and POPIA rights, matching the site's existing gold-on-black
  brand and typography.
- New `terms.html`: acceptable use, subscription/payment terms, service
  availability, data ownership (incorporating the Privacy Policy by
  reference), limitation of liability, governing law (Republic of South
  Africa).
- `index.html`'s footer links updated from the `mailto:` placeholders to
  the real pages.
- Verified both parse as well-formed HTML (`html.parser`), not just
  visually checked.

Also flagged and got fixed in `lrxtechgroup/lrxone`: the app frontend's
`RegisterPage.tsx` had its own "Terms of Service"/"Privacy Policy" links
pointing at `/terms`/`/privacy` *relative to `app.lrxone.com`* — routes
that don't exist in that app's router at all (confirmed - the catch-all
route there redirects to `/login`). Now points at the real pages built
here instead.

## 2026-07-25/26 — Fixed the two gaps from the first review, merged to main

Branch `fix/footer-links-favicon-robots` (off `main`), merged in:

- Footer `/privacy` and `/terms` links pointed at pages that don't exist
  — pointed both at a `mailto:` instead of fabricating legal content.
  Real Privacy Policy / Terms of Service pages still need to be written
  by the site owner and linked once they exist.
- Added an inline-SVG favicon, `robots.txt`, and `sitemap.xml` (linked
  from `robots.txt`).
- Footer copyright year was hardcoded — made it dynamic via a small
  inline script.

## 2026-07-25 — First review of this repo (no prior MEMORY/TODO existed)

This is the marketing/product landing page for LRX One, a single static
`index.html` (519 lines, no build process, no JS logic, nothing dynamic —
just HTML/CSS with inline SVG icons). Reviewed directly (not delegated to a
subagent — small enough for a direct read). No code changes made.

Nothing structurally wrong: no security issues (no scripts executing
untrusted data, no forms, no user input), clean semantic HTML, responsive
breakpoints present, `prefers-reduced-motion` respected. Two minor gaps
found, logged in `TODO.md`:
- Footer links to `/privacy` and `/terms` that don't exist anywhere in the
  repo (no routing/redirect layer either — this is a single static file).
- No favicon, robots.txt, or sitemap.xml.

This repo had never had a `MEMORY.md`/`TODO.md` before — this entry is the
first, done alongside similar first-pass reviews of the other
`lrxtechgroup` org repos.

## Repo orientation (for future sessions — not a changelog entry)

- Single-file static site: `index.html`. No build step, no dependencies,
  no CI/CD workflow of any kind.
- Sibling site: `lrxtechgroup/lrxtechgroup-website` (the parent company's
  own marketing page — same structure, same two gaps).
